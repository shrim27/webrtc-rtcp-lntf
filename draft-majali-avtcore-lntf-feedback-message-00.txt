              RTCP feedback Message for Loss Notification
             draft-majali-avtcore-lntf-feedback-message-00

Abstract

   Real-time media streams that use RTP, use multiple mechanisms to
   recover from packet and frame loss.  Sender to recover frame loss
   effectively, it can use information on the last frame receiver
   successfully decoded and latest packet it received on network.  This
   document describes an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback message
   intended to notify the sender with loss details.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes RTCP feedback message Loss Notification (LNTF)
   during packet loss, containing information about the latest frame
   decoded and latest packet received by the receiver.  This feedback is
   beneficial in video streaming; video encoder can use this information
   to encode future frames by referencing successfully decoded frames.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  LNTF Message

   LNTF message is identified by payload type defined as Payload-
   Specific Feedback message (PSFB).

   The fields V, P, FMT, PT, length and SSRC are defined in the RTP
   specification Section 6.1 of [RFC4585], the respective meaning being
   summarized below:

   version (V): 2 bits
      This field identifies the RTP version.  The current version is 2

   padding (P): 1 bit
      If set, the padding bit indicates that the packet contains
      additional padding octets at the end that are not part of the
      control information but are included in the length field.

   feedback message type (FMT): 5 bits
      This field identifies the type of the FB message.  It must have
      the value 15, Application layer FB message

   payload type (PT): 8 bits
      This is the RTCP packet type that identifies the packet as being
      an RTCP FB message.  The value must be PT=206, Payload-specific
      message (PSFB)

   length: 16 bits
      The length of this packet in 32-bit words minus one, including the
      header and any padding.  This is in line with the definition of
      the length field used in RTCP sender and receiver reports
      Section 6.4.1 of [RFC3550]

   SSRC of packet sender: 32 bits
      The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
      packet

   SSRC of media source: 32 bits
      The synchronization source identifier of the media source that
      this piece of feedback information is related to.

   Unique identifier: 32 bits
      LNTF message is identified by ASCII characters ‘L’, ‘N’, ‘T’, ‘F’
      (0x4C4E5446).

   Last Decoded Sequence Number: 16 bits
      RTP sequence number of last frame decoded, first packet sequence
      number of the frame is chosen.

   Last Decoded Sequence Number: 16 bits
      RTP sequence number of last frame decoded, first packet sequence
      number of the frame is chosen.

Internet-Draft                  RTCP LNTF                       May 2024


   Last Received Sequence Number Delta: 15 bits
      Delta between last received sequence number and last decoded
      sequence number.

   Decodability flag (D): 1 bit
      Decodability flag indicates if last packet received is part of the
      frame which potentially can be decoded.  D=true for key frame
      without RTP sequence gaps in that keyframe or frame with all
      dependencies decodable.  Frame with sequence number gap has
      D=false.

3.  SDP Definitions

   This section defines Session Description Protocol (SDP) signaling for
   LNTF feedback that can be employed by applications.

   rtcp-fb-syntax = "a=rtcp-fb:" rtcp-fb-pt SP rtcp-fb-val CRLF

   rtcp-fb-pt              = "*" ; wildcard: applies to all formats

                           = /fmt ; as defined in SDP

   rtcp-fb-val             = "lntf"

   The literals of the above grammar have the following semantics:
   Feedback type "lntf": This feedback type indicates loss notification.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication of this document as an RFC (if it is decided to
   publish it), IANA is requested to register the string "lntf" in its
   registry of "rtcp-fb" values in the SDP attribute registry group.

5.  Security Considerations

   This is not different from security considerations for any other RTCP
   message.
